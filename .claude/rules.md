# Claude Code Rules

## Commit Messages
- Keep titles concise, one line only
- Use "fix:", "feat:", "chore:" prefixes
- Never use "and" - use "&" or omit conjunctions
- Focus on the main change, not implementation details

## Communication
- Be direct & concise
- Minimize explanatory text
- Answer what was asked, nothing more
- Use "&" instead of "and" in lists

## Code Changes
- Read files before editing
- Follow existing patterns
- Never commit without explicit request
- Test changes before suggesting commits
