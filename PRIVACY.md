# Privacy Policy for Gmail Manager MCP

## Overview

Gmail Manager MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that helps you manage your Gmail inbox. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our application.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Access
- **Gmail Data**: When you authorize the application, it can access your Gmail emails, labels, and basic account information as specified by these OAuth scopes:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` - for reading, sending, deleting, and modifying emails and labels
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic` - for accessing basic Gmail settings
- **Local Configuration**: OAuth credentials and authentication tokens are stored locally on your device.

### What We Don't Collect
- **No Data Transmission**: Gmail Manager MCP runs entirely on your local machine. We do not collect, store, or transmit your email data to any external servers.
- **No Analytics**: We do not collect usage analytics, tracking data, or personal information.
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: Your Gmail data is never shared with third parties.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only
- **OAuth Credentials**: Stored in `~/.gmail-mcp/credentials.json` on your local machine
- **Configuration Files**: OAuth keys (`gcp-oauth.keys.json`) are stored locally as specified by you
- **No Cloud Storage**: No data is stored on our servers or in the cloud

### Data Security
- All authentication uses Google's OAuth 2.0 standard security protocols
- Credentials are stored locally using Google's recommended security practices
- Communication with Gmail uses HTTPS encryption

## Data Retention

- **Local Control**: You have complete control over your data since it's stored locally
- **Data Deletion**: Uninstalling the application or deleting the `~/.gmail-mcp/` directory removes all stored credentials
- **Revoke Access**: You can revoke the application's access to your Gmail account at any time through your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

## Third-Party Services

### Google Services

- Google's privacy policy applies to their services: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Authentication is handled directly by Google's secure OAuth flow

### No Other Third Parties
- We do not use analytics services, advertising networks, or other third-party data processors
- The application operates entirely between your local machine and Google's services
